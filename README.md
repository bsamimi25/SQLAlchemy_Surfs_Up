## Overview
The purpose of this project was to determine temperatures of the island of Oahu during June and December. We wanted to provide summary statistics to our investor so he can make a decision on his potential future shop. The weather will determine if his business survives or not since it is an ice cream and curf shp. 

# Results
The June and December dates are from 2010-2017.

Major Points
- June is about 4 degrees hotter than December. 
- Maximum for June and December are very similar around 85(June) and 83(Dec) degrees.
- Min for June is higher than December as expected. But note they are withing range of each other. 

## Summary
Our results showed that the business proposal of an ice cream surf shop on the island of Oahu is promising and can forecast the weather for the future. It seems that there is at least 70 degrees year around on the island which means that the weather is good enoguh for business. 

To go into a bit more depth within this analysis, I would look at the data by year individually going from 2010 to 2017 and look at those descriptive statistics each year to see if there was a trend of increasing or decreasing weather trends for June and December. 

Secondly, I would make a another query when I would specificy look at ranges of months. From June to August then December to Februrary. Then look at the historical data withing those ranges by using summary statistics.
